### Communication ###
#### English ####
This is a 100% English class. English is the official language in the class,
which requests all students to produce all results in English, including homework, assignment report, answer
sheet of midterm/final exam. Note that non-English descriptions will be excluded
in all kinds of evaluations of your submissions.

In meetings, the instructor will use English. It is highly recommended for
the class participants to use English as well for discussion, yet they are allowed
to use Korean in asking and answering questions; the instructor will repeat
Korean sayings in English.
