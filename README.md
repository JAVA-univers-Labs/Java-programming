### Class Information ###
* Meetings: **Tue** 10AM-11:15AM (1.5h) & **Fri** 9AM-11:15AM (2.5h) in NTH 412
	* TA Help Hour (optional): Thur 8PM-9PM in OH 316 (aka. Coding Space)

### Course Objectives ###
Having *Java* as a learning material, this course aims to give essential knowledge and programming experiences to beginner level Computer Science students. 
This course is designed for novice Java programmers to equip fluency in reading and writing Java code. To accomplish the goal, students will have a series of programming labs (usually at Friday meetings). In addition to the programming practices, this course assists students understanding the key concepts in computer science and software design in the context of Java programming (usually at Tuesday meetings). The instructor will leads the class to discussions on the following issues:
(1) How can we solve a problem by programming, especially with Java
(2) How can we use programming to build up a software system systematically
(3) What is about Java, especially compared to other programming languages.


### Learning Materials ###
#### Main Textbook ####
[**Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming, 7th Edition**](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Introduction-Problem-Solving-Programming/dp/0133766268/) (JIPP), authored by *Walter Savitch*     
You can find this book at Handong Books which is on campus.  It is **mandatory** for each student to equip this book: it will be assumed that each student has a textbook in lab sessions, reading assignments, homework, practice, etc.
