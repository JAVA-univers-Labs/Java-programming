1. Explain how array of Java is different from array of C (10 points)
2. Write a static method `createStrCube` which receives 3 integers `x`, `y`, `z` and 
   returns a 3-dimensional String array which contains  *x*⨉*y*⨉*z* number of empty string objects 
   (i.e., `length()` returns 0). (6 points)
3. Explain why Java has the Interface mechanism, while it provides Class extension to construct 
   Class hierarchies (9 points)
4. Give a Java program example with an execution scenario that exemplify dynamic binding of Java method. (10 points)
5. Suppose that a method has a try-catch statement with multiple catch-blocks. 
   Explain how an Exception thrown at the try-block will be handled. (6 points)
6. Explain runtime exception in Java (4 points)
7. Define a generic class `Pair` which takes two type parameters `X` and `Y`. 
   A `Pair` object consists of two members objects (i.e., first one and second one). 
   The two type parameters declare the type of the first element and the type of the second element, respectively.
   `Pair` has one constructor that receives first and second elements. 
   Two `Pair` objects are determined as equivalent when their first elements are equivalent, and 
   the second elements are equivalents at the same time (5 points)
